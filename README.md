# Firebase Test

This is an extremely basic test of the real-time chat functionality of Firebase and Angular.  To use, simply create an `init.js` file in the `/public` directory and include the Javascript provided when creating a new Firebase project.

You'll also want to make sure that your database has read and write prednisone allowed for the `messages` node.
